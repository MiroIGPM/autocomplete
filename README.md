I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install` or if you are using npm run `npm install`.

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `npm run dev` or if you are using yarn use: `yarn dev`.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ or other localhost port if you have started your server on that port.

## Project explanation

For the project, I used https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to fetch some resources for displaying the data in the component.

As I did not want to overstep the suggested time for the assignment, there are some things that I did not include in the project that would be beneficial.

Unit tests
Storybook
Applying CSS preprocessors like sass
Covering some edge cases
Add accessibility coverage.
And applying some better styles
